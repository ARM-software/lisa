    Agenda
        An agenda specifies what is to be done during a Workload Automation
        run. This includes which workloads will be run, with what configuration
        and which augmentations will be enabled, etc. (For more information
        please see :ref:`here <agenda-reference>`.)

    Augmentation
        Augmentations are plugins that augment the execution of
        workload jobs with additional functionality; usually, that takes the
        form of generating additional metrics and/or artifacts, such as traces
        or logs. For more information please see
        :ref:`augmentations <augmentations>`.

    Artifact
        An artifact is something that was been generated as part of the run
        for example a file containing output or meta data in the form of log
        files. WA supports multiple "kinds" of artifacts and will handle them
        accordingly, for more information please see :ref:`here <artifact>`.

    Instrument
        A WA "Instrument" can be quite diverse in its functionality, but
        the majority of those available in are there to collect some kind of
        additional data (such as trace, energy readings etc.) from the device
        during workload execution. To see available instruments please use the
        :ref:`list command <list-command>` or see the
        :ref:`Plugin Reference <instruments>`.

    Job
        An individual instance of a workload. E.g. Even if you only have 1
        workload to run but wanted 5 iterations then 5 individual jobs will be
        generated to be ran.

    Output Processor
        An "Output Processor" is what is used to process the output
        generated by a workload. They can simply store the results in a presentable
        format or use the information collected to generate additional metrics.
        To see available instruments please use the
        :ref:`list command <list-command>` or see the
        :ref:`Plugin Reference <instruments>`.

    Spec
        A specification of a workload. For example you can have a single
        workload specification that is then executed multiple times if you
        desire multiple iterations but the configuration for the workload will
        remain the same.

    WA
        Workload Automation. The full name of this framework.
