.. Workload Automation 3 documentation master file,

================================================
Welcome to Documentation for Workload Automation
================================================

Workload Automation (WA) is a framework for executing workloads and collecting
measurements on Android and Linux devices. WA includes automation for nearly 30
workloads, some common instrumentation (ftrace, hwmon). A number of output
formats are supported.

Workload Automation is designed primarily as a developer tool/framework to
facilitate data driven development by providing a method of collecting
measurements from a device in a repeatable way.

Workload Automation is highly extensible. Most of the concrete functionality is
implemented via :ref:`plug-ins <plugin-reference>`, and it is easy to
:ref:`write new plug-ins <writing-plugins>` to support new device types,
workloads, instruments or output processing.
