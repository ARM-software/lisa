Run Configuration
------------------
In addition to specifying run execution parameters through an agenda, the
behaviour of WA can be modified through configuration file(s). The default
configuration file is ``~/.workload_automation/config.yaml``  (the location can
be changed by setting ``WA_USER_DIRECTORY`` environment variable, see
:ref:`envvars` section below). This file will be created when you first run WA
if it does not already exist. This file must always exist and will always be
loaded. You can add to or override the contents of that file on invocation of
Workload Automation by specifying an additional configuration file using
``--config`` option. Variables with specific names  will be picked up by the
framework and used to modify the behaviour of Workload automation e.g.
the ``iterations`` variable might be specified to tell WA how many times to run
each workload.

Meta Configuration
------------------

There are also a couple of settings are used to provide additional metadata
for a run. These may get picked up by instruments or output processors to
attach context to results.

.. _envvars:

Environment Variables
---------------------

In addition to standard configuration described above, WA behaviour can be
altered through environment variables. These can determine where WA looks for
various assets when it starts.

:WA_USER_DIRECTORY: This is the location WA will look for config.yaml, plugins,
   dependencies, and it will also be used for local caches, etc. If this
   variable is not set, the default location is ``~/.workload_automation`` (this
   is created when WA is installed).

   .. note:: This location **must** be writable by the user who runs WA.


:WA_LOG_BUFFER_CAPACITY: Specifies the capacity (in log records) for the early
    log handler which is used to buffer log records until a log file becomes
    available. If the is not set, the default value of ``1000`` will be used.
    This should sufficient for most scenarios, however this may need to be
    increased, e.g. if plugin loader scans a very large number of locations;
    this may also be set to a lower value to reduce WA's memory footprint on
    memory-constrained hosts.

.. _config-merging:

Configuration Merging
---------------------
WA configuration can come from various sources of increasing priority, as well
as being specified in a generic and specific manner. For example WA's global
config file would be considered the least specific vs the parameters of a
workload in an agenda which would be the most specific. WA has two rules for the
priority of configuration:

    - Configuration from higher priority sources overrides configuration from
      lower priority sources.
    - More specific configuration overrides less specific configuration.

There is a situation where these two rules come into conflict. When a generic
configuration is given in config source of high priority and a specific
configuration is given in a config source of lower priority. In this situation
it is not possible to know the end users intention and WA will error.

This functionality allows for defaults for plugins, targets etc. to be
configured at a global level and then seamless overridden without the need to
remove the high level configuration.

Dependent on specificity, configuration parameters from different sources will
have different inherent priorities. Within an agenda, the configuration in
"workload" entries wil be more specific than "sections" entries, which in turn
are more specific than parameters in the "config" entry.
