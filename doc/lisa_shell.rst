LISA shell
**********

.. TODO:: Have the shell manpage here

Once you have all of the required dependencies installed, you can use the LISA
shell, which provides a convenient set of commands for easy access to many LISA
related functions:

  .. code-block:: sh

     source init_env

.. note::

   This is done automatically by vagrant, so you don't have to issue this
   command after doing a ``vagrant ssh``

.. tip:: Run ``lisa-help`` to see an overview of the provided LISA commands.
