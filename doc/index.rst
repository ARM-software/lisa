LISA API Documentation
==============================================

LISA - "Linux Integrated System Analysis" is a toolkit for interactive analysis
and automated regression testing of Linux kernel behaviour. To get started with LISA:

- See the README on the project's `Github home page`__ for an overview.
- Check out the project's `Github Wiki`__ for some guides to installation
  and setup.
- Once you have LISA running, take a look at the tutorial and example notebooks
  included with the installation.

This site contains documentation for LISA's APIs. For some parts of LISA, API
documentation is a work-in-progress. Where the API documentation is lacking, see
the example/tutorial notebooks provided with LISA, or just dive in and read the
code. Contributions to LISA and its documentation are very welcome, and handled
via Github pull requests.
