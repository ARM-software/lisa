All folders here are clones of other repositories imported using git subtree.
See external/subtrees.conf for the list of upstream URLs for each of these.

A public commit in that repo *MUST NOT* modify both these folders and other
folders.

If that happens, subsequent git subtree split/push will always contain these
quick fix commits. That means a git subtree split will always need a git rebase
to clean them up before pushing to the upstream project, which is annoying. In
case a commit does go through, it is possible to remove the subtree altogether,
and then git subtree add it again (without --squash) to create a new clean
base.
