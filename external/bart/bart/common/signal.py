**Signals**

    - Definition

        A signal is a string representation of a TRAPpy event and the
        column in the same event. The signal can be of two types:

            - *Pivoted Signal*

                A pivoted signal has a pivot specified in its event class.
                This means that the signal in the event is a concatenation of different
                signals which belong to different **pivot** nodes. The analysis for pivoted
                signals must be done by decomposing them into pivoted signals for each node.

                For example, an even that represents the load of the CPU can be pivoted on
                :code:`"cpu"` which should be a column in the event's `DataFrame`

            - *Non-Pivoted Signal*

                A non pivoted signal has an event that has no pivot value associated with it.
                This probably means that signal has one component and can be analysed without
                decomposing it into smaller signals.

    - Representation

        The following are valid representations of a signal

        - :code:`"event_name:event_column"`
        - :code:`"trappy.event.class:event_column"`

              the trappy event (:mod:`trappy.base.Base`) has a pivot
              parameter which is equal to :code:`"cpu"`. Then the signal B
              should also have :code:`"cpu"` as it's pivot.
