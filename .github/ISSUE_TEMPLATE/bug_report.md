**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
* what part of LISA is being used (synthetic tests, WA-related features, etc.)

* what code is being run if that is a custom script using LISA APIs

**Expected behavior/what was the purpose of the experiment**

Giving the overall purpose of the script you are trying to get to work can help us identify which part of the API you may benefit from much more quickly.

**Logs of the error**
info and debug can be found under the artifacts as INFO.log and DEBUG.log.
The header of the log is useful as it gives plenty of information on python version and similar things.
