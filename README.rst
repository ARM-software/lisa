Workload Automation
+++++++++++++++++++

Workload Automation (WA) is a framework for executing workloads and collecting
measurements on Android and Linux devices. WA includes automation for nearly 40
workloads and supports some common instrumentation (ftrace, hwmon) along with a
number of output formats.

WA is designed primarily as a developer tool/framework to facilitate data driven
development by providing a method of collecting measurements from a device in a
repeatable way.

WA is highly extensible. Most of the concrete functionality is implemented via
plug-ins, and it is easy to write new plug-ins to support new device types,
workloads, instruments or output processing.


Requirements
