# This is an example of a simple agenda: It simply runs the exoplayer workload 3
# times. The workload parameters (such as video playback duration) are left to
# the workload's default, and target and instrumentation configuration will
# either be read from $LISA_HOME/tools/wltests/wa_user_directory/config.yaml or
# the defaults will be used.

  - name: exoplayer
