Internal API

.. warning:: This API is for now considered completely internal and could
   change at any time, except for items listed in :ref:`public-api`

Engine
======

.. Since there is nothing actually defined in that module, it is just a
   reference target for other parts of the doc. It is placed right before
   exekall.engine so jumping to that reference will lead at the right place.
