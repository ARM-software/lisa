# LISA Target configuration required by devlib to connect to a target.
#
# See the doc for available keys:
# https://tooling.sites.arm.com/lisa/latest/target.html#lisa.target.TargetConf
#

target-conf:
    # Kind of platform
    # - linux   : accessed via SSH connection
    # - android : accessed via ADB connection
    # - host    : run on the local host
    # kind : android

    # Board
    # Optional board name used for better prettier logs
    # name: myboard

    # Target IP or domain name
    # host: 192.168.0.20

    # Target Android device ID
    # device: 00b1346f0878ccb1

    # Login username (has to be sudo enabled)
    # username: root

    # Login credentials
    # You can specify either a password or keyfile
    # password: "mypassword"
    # keyfile: /complete/path/of/your/keyfile

    # Optional kernel module configuration
    # kernel:
        # Path to the kernel sources. If left out, a kernel.org tarball will be
        # used (with varying degree of success)
        # src: /path/to/kernel/src/tree

        # Module compiling options
        # modules:
            # Variables passed to make command line while building modules.
            # make-variables:
                # Setting "LLVM: 1" is a good idea as clang is a cross
                # compiler by default. Just using "CC: clang" will still use
                # parts of the GNU toolchain.
                # LLVM: 1

            # Either "host" or "alpine". If "alpine" is used, an Alpine chroot
            # will be used to build the kernel module in. Works best with
            # "LLVM: 1" for reproducible builds regardless of the build-env.
            #
            # build-env: host
            # It is possible to specify some parameters to build-env, such as
            # Alpine version:
            # build-env:
            #     build-env: alpine
            #     build-env-settings:
            #         alpine:
            #              version: 3.18
            #              packages:
            #                  - foobar

            # Usually not needed: "overlayfs" will overlay folders using
            # overlayfs. "copy" will use plain slow copies.
            # overlay-backend: overlayfs


    # Optional devlib configuration
    # devlib:
        # Devlib modules names to enable/disable for all the experiment
        # excluded-modules: []
        #
        # devlib Platform subclass to use, with the keyword arguments to use it
        # platform:
            # Defaults to devlib.platform.Platform
            # class: devlib.platform.Platform
            # args:
                # arg1: foo
                # arg2: bar

    # Optional additional binary tools to install by default for all experiments
    # Currently available tools:
    # - binaries under ./tools/<ARCH>/
    #   where <ARCH> is one of the supported target
    #   architectures
    # - shell scripts under './tools/scripts/
    # tools: []
    #

# Ftrace collector configuration
ftrace-conf:
    # Additional ftrace events and functions collected regardless of the
    # test configuration
    # events: []
    # functions: []
    #
    # ftrace buffer size
    # buffer-size: 42

# Platform information
#
# Various bits of information about the platform used by LISA
#
platform-info:
    # Include a preset platform-info file, instead of defining the keys directly here.
    # Note that you cannot use !include and define keys at the same time.
    # !include $LISA_HOME/lisa/platforms/juno_r0.yml
    # conf:
        # rtapp:
            # # Calibration mapping of CPU numbers to calibration value for rtapp
            # calib: {}
