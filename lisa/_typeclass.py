"""
This module provides a trait system known as typeclasses in Haskell and Scala,
and known as trait in Rust.

The fundamental idea is to decouple the followings:

    1. definition of an interface as a set of methods to implement.
    2. implementation of the aforementioned methods for a given class.
    3. the class definitions themselves.

Decoupling *2.* and *3.* allows providing implementation of the interface on
any type, including foreign types coming from other libraries, or even builtin
types. This is the core benefit from typeclasses as opposed to regular classes
in Object Oriented Programming. They allow extending existing types without
having to modify their inheritance hierarchy.

.. note:: The names of the concepts are drawn from Haskell typeclasses:

    * *typeclass*: This is the description of an interface, as a set of mandatory
      methods to implement, and optionally helper functions with default
      implementations. It's pretty close in concept to abstract base classes.

    * *superclass*: The mother typeclass of a given typeclass.

    * *instance*: This is the implementation of a given typeclass for a given
      (set of) type.

    * *values*: Values as opposed to types. Since *instance* is already used to
      refer to the implementation of a typeclass, we use the word *value*.

    * *type*: That is just a type, also known as *class* in Python.


Here is an example on how to work with typeclasses as provided by this module::

    from lisa._typeclass import TypeClass

    class FooBar(TypeClass):
        "Foobar interface"

        # TypeClass.required is an equivalent of abc.abstractmethod: It forces
        # implementations of a given set of method
        @TypeClass.required
        def my_method(self):
            pass

        # This helper can be used in the implementation of the typeclass, and
        # can be overriden by any instance.
        def extra_helper(self):
            return 42

    class ARandomClass:
        "Just a random class, it could be anything"
        pass

    # ``types`` can be either a tuple of types or a single type
    class ARandomClassFooBarInstance(FooBar, types=(ARandomClass, int)):
        "Implement the FooBar typeclass for both ARandomClass type and int at once."
        def my_method(self):
            return 'ARandomClass or int value'


    value = ARandomClass()

    # Both are equivalent
    # The @ version is more useful when combining multiple typeclasses on the fly
    value_as_foobar = FooBar(value)
    value_as_foobar = value @ FooBar

    # Inplace variant allows to "cast" the value directly.
    # These are all equivalent:
    # value @= FooBar
    # value = value @ FooBar
    # value = FooBar(value)

    # The typeclass machinery will dispatch the call to my_method() to the
    # right implementation
    value_as_foobar.my_method()

    # We also implemented FooBar for int type
    FooBar(3).my_method()

    # Raises a TypeError, since there is no instance for float
    FooBar(3.0).my_method()

    # Add an instance of FooBar for float type
    class FloatFooBarInstance(FooBar, types=float):
        def my_method(self):
            return 'float'

    # Now works once we added the instance
    FooBar(3.0).my_method()


Classmethod also work, so typeclasses can be used to define factory interfaces::

    from lisa._typeclass import TypeClass

    class FromString(TypeClass):
        "Build a value by parsing a string"

        @TypeClass.required
        @classmethod
        def from_str(cls, string):
            pass

    class IntFromStringInstance(FromString, types=int):
        @classmethod
        def from_str(cls, string):
            # Although cls is a value of type TypeProxy, it can be called just
            # like a regular class
            return cls(string)


    # Types can be cast just like values, so we can use the classmethods and
    # the staticmethods on them as well
    assert 33 == FromString(int).from_str('33')

A more advanced usage can involve a hierarchy of typeclasses that gets combined together::

    from lisa._typeclass import TypeClass

    class MyTP1(TypeClass):
        @TypeClass.required
        def meth1(self):
            pass

        @TypeClass.required
        def another_meth(self):
            pass


    class MyTP2(TypeClass):
        @TypeClass.required
        def meth2(self):
            pass

    class IntTP1Instance(MyTP1, types=int):
        def meth1(self):
            return 'int'

        def another_meth(self):
            return 42

    class IntTP2Instance(MyTP2, types=int):
        def meth2(self):
            return 'int'

        # Reuse an existing function implementation
        another_meth = IntTP1Instance.another_meth

    # Both are equivalent and allow creating a typeclass that provides
    # interfaces of both MyTP1 and MyTP2. If some methods are required by both
    # MyTP1 and MyTP2, the conflict is detected and a TypeError is raised:
    MyTP1AndMyTP2 = MyTP1 & MyTP2

    # This combined typeclass will automatically get the instances from its
    # superclasses
    class MyTP1AndMyTP2(MyTP1, MyTP2):
       pass

    # All are equivalent
    value = 2 @ (MyTP1 & MyTP2)
    value = 2 @ MyTP1AndMyTP2
    value = MyTP1AndMyTP2(2)
    value = (MyTP1 & MyTP2)(2)

    # We can now use the API of both MyTP1 and MyTP2
    value.meth1()
    value.meth2()


Note that it's possible to implement a typeclass for a type that has no values,
but for which ``isinstance(value, thetype)`` will return true. This can be
achieved using ``__instancecheck__`` or ``__subclasscheck__`` and is used in
particular by the abstract base classes provided by :mod:`collections.abc`.
:class:`lisa._generic.TypedList` is another example. Casting values "registered" as
instances of these types is expensive though, as validity of the cast depends
on the value itself. That means it's not possible to memoize the result of the
cast associated it with the type of the value.


One might wonder what casting a value to a typeclass gives. When possible, a
new value with a synthetic type is returned. That is implemented using a
shallow copy of the value, and then updating its ``__class__`` attribute. This
will provide native attribute lookup speed, and casting will be efficient. If
that is not possible (non-heap types, types using ``__slots__`` etc), an
instance of :class:`lisa._typeclass.ValueProxy` will be returned for values, and
a synthetic type will be created for types.
