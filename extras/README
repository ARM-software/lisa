This directory is intended for miscellaneous extra stuff that may be
useful while developing Workload Automation. It should *NOT* contain
anything necessary for *using* workload automation.  Whenever you add
something to this directory, please also add a short description of
what it is in this file.

Dockerfile
        Docker file for generating a Docker image containing WA,
        devlib, and the required parts of the Android SDK. This can be
        run in a container to avoid configuring WA on the host. Should
        work "out of the box".

pylintrc 
        pylint configuration file set up for WA development (see
        comment at the top of the file for how to use).

walog.vim
        Vim syntax file for WA logs; adds highlighting similar to what
        comes out in the console. See comment in the file for how to
        enable it.
