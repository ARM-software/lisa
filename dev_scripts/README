This directory contains scripts that aid the development of Workload Automation.
They were written to work as part of WA development environment and are not
guarnteed to work if moved outside their current location. They should not be
distributed as part of WA releases.

Scripts
-------

:clean_install: Performs a clean install of WA from source. This will remove any
                existing WA install (regardless of whether it was made from
                source or through a tarball with pip).

:clear_env: Clears ~/.workload_automation.

:get_apk_versions: Prints out a table of APKs and their versons found under the
                   path specified as the argument.

:pep8: Runs flake8 (formerly called "pep8") code checker (must be
       installed) over wa/ with the correct settings for WA.

:pylint: Runs pylint (must be installed) over wlauto with the correct settings
         for WA.

:rebuild_all_uiauto: Rebuild UIAutomator APKs for workloads that have them. This
                     is useful to make sure they're all using the latest
                     uiauto.arr after the latter has been updated.

:update_copyrights: Checks and updates the year of the copyright in source files,
                    adding a copyright header if it's not already there.
