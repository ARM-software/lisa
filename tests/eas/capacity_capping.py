    Goal
    ====

    Verify that dynamic CPU capacity capping works in the system.

    Detailed Description
    ====================

    The maximum frequency of a core can be restricted to a lower value
    than its absolute maximum frequency.  This may happen because of
    thermal management or as a request from userspace via sysfs.
    Dynamic CPU capacity capping provides PELT and the scheduler CPU
    capacity management with a maximum frequency scaling corrector
    which describes the influence of running a CPU with a current
    maximum frequency lower than the absolute maximum frequency.

    The test creates as many busy threads as there are big cpus.
    These busy threads have high load and should run in the CPUs with
    highest capacity.  The test has three phases of equal length.  In
    the first phase, the system runs unconstrained.  In the second
    phase, the maximum frequency of the big cpus is limited to the
    lowest frequency that the big frequency domain can run at.
    Finally, in the third phase, the maximum frequency of the big cpus
    is restored to its absolute maximum, i.e. the system is
    unconstrained again.

    This test assumes that the lowest OPPs of the big cpus have less
    capacity than the highest OPP of the little cpus.  If that is not
    the case, this test will fail.  Arguably, capacity capping is not
    needed in such a system.

    Expected Behaviour
    ==================

    The threads have high load, so they should always run in the CPUs
    with the highest capacity of the system.  In the first phase the
    system is unconstrained, so they should run on the big CPUs.  In
    the second phase, the big cluster's maximum frequency is limited
    and the little CPUs have higher capacity.  Therefore, in the
    second phase of the test, the threads should migrate to the little
    cpus.  In the third phase the maximum frequency of the big cpus is
    restored, so they become again the CPUs with the higest capacity
    in the system.  The busy threads must run on the big cpus in the
    third phase.
