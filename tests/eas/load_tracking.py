    ====================
    This test runs the same workload on the most capable CPU on the system at a
    cross section of available frequencies. The trace is then examined to find
    the average activation length of the workload, which is combined with the
    known period to estimate an expected mean value for util_avg for each
    frequency. The util_avg value is extracted from scheduler trace events and
    its mean is compared with the expected value (ignoring the first 300ms so
    that the signal can stabilize). The test fails if the observed mean is
    beyond a certain error margin from the expected one. load_avg is then
    similarly compared with the expected util_avg mean, under the assumption
    that load_avg should equal util_avg when system load is light.

    Expected Behaviour

    Load tracking signals are scaled so that the workload results in roughly the
