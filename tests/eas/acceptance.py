    Goal
    ====

    Big cpus pull big tasks from little cpus when they become idle

    Detailed Description
    ====================

    This test runs twice as many tasks are there are big cpus.  All
    these tasks are big tasks.  Half of them are called
    "early_starter" and the other half "migrator".  The migrator tasks
    start 1 second after the early_starter tasks.  As the big cpus are
    fully utilized when the migrator tasks start, some tasks are
    offloaded to the little cpus.  As the big cpus finish their tasks,
    they pull tasks from the little to complete them.

    Expected Behaviour
    ==================

    As there are as many early_starter tasks as there are big cpus,
    the early_starter tasks should run in the big cpus until they
    finish.  When the migrator tasks start, there is no spare capacity
    in the big cpus so they run on the little cpus.  Once the big cpus
    finish with the early_starters, they should pull the migrator
    tasks and run them.

    It is possible that when the migrator tasks start they do it on
    big cpus and they end up displacing the early starters.  This is
    acceptable behaviour.  As long as big cpus are fully utilized
    running big tasks, the scheduler is doing a good job.

    That is why this test doesn't test for migrations of the migrator
    tasks to the bigs when we expect that the early starters have
    finished.  Instead, it tests that:

      * The big cpus were fully loaded as long as there are tasks left
        to run in the system

      * The little cpus run tasks while the bigs are busy (offload migration)

      * All tasks get a chance on a big cpu (either because they
        started there or because of idle pull)

      * All tasks are finished off in a big cpu.
