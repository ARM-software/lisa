LONG_DESCRIPTION = """TRAPpy is a framework written in python for
analysing and plotting FTrace data by converting it into standardised
PANDAS DataFrames (tabular times series data representation).The goal is to
allow developers easy and systematic access to FTrace data and leverage
the flexibility of PANDAS for the analysis.

TRAPpy also provides functionality to build complex statistical analysis
based on the underlying FTrace data.
