TRAPpy [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ARM-Software/trappy.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ARM-Software/trappy)
======

trappy is a visualization tool to help analyze data generated on a
device. It depends on ipython notebook and pandas. First install these
dependencies if you don't have them already:

    $ apt-get install ipython-notebook python-pandas

Now launch the ipython notebook server:

    $ ipython notebook

This should pop up a browser. If it doesn't, open a web browser and go
to http://localhost:8888/tree/

In the `doc/` folder there's a `00 - Quick start` which describes how to
run trappy. Other notebooks in that directory describe other functions
of trappy.
