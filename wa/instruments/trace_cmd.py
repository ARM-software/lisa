    trace-cmd is an instrument which interacts with ftrace Linux kernel internal
    tracer

    From trace-cmd man page:

    trace-cmd command interacts with the ftrace tracer that is built inside the
    Linux kernel. It interfaces with the ftrace specific files found in the
    debugfs file system under the tracing directory.

    trace-cmd reads a list of events it will trace, which can be specified in
    the config file as follows ::

        trace_events = ['irq*', 'power*']

    If no event is specified, a default set of events that are generally considered useful
    for debugging/profiling purposes will be enabled.

    The list of available events can be obtained by rooting and running the
    following command line on the device ::

       trace-cmd list

    You may also specify ``trace_buffer_size`` setting which must be an integer
    that will be used to set the ftrace buffer size. It will be interpreted as
    KB::

        trace_cmd_buffer_size = 8000

    The maximum buffer size varies from device to device, but there is a
    maximum and trying to set buffer size beyond that will fail. If you plan
    on collecting a lot of trace over long periods of time, the buffer size
    will not be enough and you will only get trace for the last portion of your
    run. To deal with this you can set the ``trace_mode`` setting to
    ``'record'`` (the default is ``'start'``)::

        trace_cmd_mode = 'record'

    This will cause trace-cmd to trace into file(s) on disk, rather than the
    buffer, and so the limit for the max size of the trace is set by the
    storage available on device. Bear in mind that ``'record'`` mode *is* more
    intrusive than the default, so if you do not plan on generating a lot of
    trace, it is best to use the default ``'start'`` mode.

    .. note:: Mode names correspond to the underlying trace-cmd executable's
              command used to implement them. You can find out more about what
              is happening in each case from trace-cmd documentation:
              https://lwn.net/Articles/341902/.

    This instrument comes with an trace-cmd binary that will be copied and used
    on the device, however post-processing will be, by default, done on-host and you must
    have trace-cmd installed and in your path. On Ubuntu systems, this may be
    done with::

        sudo apt-get install trace-cmd

    Alternatively, you may set ``report_on_target`` parameter to ``True`` to enable on-target
    processing (this is useful when running on non-Linux hosts, but is likely to take longer
    and may fail on particularly resource-constrained targets).
