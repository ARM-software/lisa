    description = '''
    A workload to perform standard productivity tasks with googleplaybooks.
    This workload performs various tasks, such as searching for a book title
    online, browsing through a book, adding and removing notes, word searching,
    and querying information about the book.

    Test description:
    1. Open Google Play Books application
    2. Dismisses sync operation (if applicable)
    3. Searches for a book title
    4. Adds books to library if not already present
    5. Opens 'My Library' contents
    6. Opens selected book
    7. Gestures are performed to swipe between pages and pinch zoom in and out of a page
    8. Selects a specified chapter based on page number from the navigation view
    9. Selects a word in the centre of screen and adds a test note to the page
    10. Removes the test note from the page (clean up)
    11. Searches for the number of occurrences of a common word throughout the book
    12. Switches page styles from 'Day' to 'Night' to 'Sepia' and back to 'Day'
    13. Uses the 'About this book' facility on the currently selected book

    NOTE: This workload requires a network connection (ideally, wifi) to run,
          a Google account to be setup on the device, and payment details for the account.
          Free books require payment details to have been setup otherwise it fails.
          Tip: Install the 'Google Opinion Rewards' app to bypass the need to enter valid
          card/bank detail.
